I am originally from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Both of my parents and both of my brothers went to The University of Tennesse, Knoxville, so it was a pretty easy choice for me when choosing where to go for college. This summer, I completed my first software engineering internship with Trimble, and I am now beginning my junior year.
